                                    <p>People often tell me that there is no other thing is as beautiful as love.<em>Love can be found everywhere from a boy towards a girl to  the Mother's love.</em> In between lovers love and parents love there is one such thing which made me better than them. <b>Today I am going to talk about the love which adds the real spice to our life.</b> Getting our partner in life will also adds spice but it is like a <em>salt or pepper type</em>. The real spice is what you get when you eat sweet corn in rainy days across streets and we use to eat Panipuri at roadside that tells you the real spice. The Value of that spice <em>I am talking about is the <strong>friendship</strong> which keeps you awake all the time from text message to  Meeting and from Quarreling to Sharing.</em> I have seen many type of them in my life. This is just a platform for me to express what I have learn from them.</p>
                                    <p>I want to take you all to every stage of friendship of my life and I try to relate them to this world. <em>Everyday in this world people are busy in their life of surviving for fittest.</em> Anyhow they work hard to be successful and work even <b>smarter</b> to rise everyday. <em>There is a life where people are reserved and their emotions are never taken to the consideration by themselves.</em> <b>Companies provide the working freedom to their employees not to express the joy of feelings.</b></p>

                                    <p>Before taking you to my friendship journey, Let me discuss with you about the world how it was and now. <strong>Present world consists of some cool stuffs to do out here.</strong> <em>There are even infinite number of ways to bite some time.</em> Let's consider all the professions in this world as a club dance in weekends, 90% of people thinks this profession is the only source to <em>lead their lives comfortably.</em> As the days goes on <b>Needs are getting decreased by the wants of Greedy People.</b></p>
                                    <p>I am no way different in that aspect concern. I too taught profession brings you <em>Fame, Money & Everything</em> you want. If you get what you want,<b>Your life will complete and you will get the reason for your birth and it will be fulfilled.</b> This is the most false thinking that I have every made. <em>Friends, Family & People</em> around me made me to feel like that. <strong>It is a Perception towards life which happened to be a great mistake.</strong> No people around me was thinking different than this. <strong>It seemed me that the world is all about knowing your wants and discovering the reason for your birth.</strong></p>
                                    <p>There is a reason for every living organism for it's birth which can be called upon you to do that at any movement. In Every stage we keep learning things more faster than other living creatures hence, we called as humans. While I was thinking about life someone asked me that what i taught about humans and how different we are from humans. we all do what they do and they do what we all do. My thinking lit up and I said directly "Because, We are humans and we are not animals." I continued "We all have got some thinking capacity, Ability to take decessions".

                                    <p>That man again laughed and replied "Son, When tiger watches it's hunt keenly it does it all." 
                                    I baffled and kept on thinking. That old man went leaving me alone and baffled. 
                                    I taught whole night about the difference. Suddenly I taught of myself <em>"How different I am than animals?"</em> 
                                    What type of life I am leading different than them in-spite of having such a master brain in me. 
                                    Like this many days passed and I engaged in parties with my studies. That was a dusk of summer when I met that man again. 
                                    <strong>From the dawn of winter to the dusk of summer he made me to wait to tell my answer.</strong> He asked me "Have you found the answer yet?" 
                                    With lots of Excitement I said "I did, The only difference I found is nothing. We are all same. 
                                    Humans got Multi-qualities of different animals. <strong>The only native thing he has got is to love someone forever in any relationship. 
                                    I have not found any friendships between animals."</strong> With satisfactory smile that man replied "You got what you do in your life. 
                                    You will be the strongest person in your life. Keep it up."</p>

                                    <p>This made me to think my life in a different way. That Perspective has taken me to see <em>the real things</em> in the world with the 
                                    hope of discovering something. I do see people struggling for food and the people doing party. All separates us with some 
                                    distinction either of Money or of Education. Suddenly I got a taught that <em>What is Education is all about? Is that all we created?</em> 
                                    From A to Z it is invented by humans to make the communication in the better way. There is an Universal language where every 
                                    species can communicate each other. <em>That may be Love which rules everything and what makes us different than Aliens.</em> 
                                    <strong>"I still believe there are many possibilities out there that every species can talk as we human speak."</strong></p>

                                    <p>Life is a ocean of Miracles in which different seasons are the different opportunities we get. We cannot explore everything 
                                    in our lifetime where Tsunami affects only few and die from it are little. <em>We cannot experience everything in our life but, 
                                    Whatever we explore we get thrilled by this life with joy and adventure.</em> I see life of some people they don't just sail instead 
                                    expects all the luxury and comforts for their journey where those things <em>eventually comes to an end like Titanic.</em> To taste the 
                                    life better, Just Keep Sailing irrespective of the ship you are in. Adapt to the situations and pursue your passion along with you. 
                                    <strong>"Only successful man can't guide you through your life. A Person has got failure than success can guide you to success."</strong> 
                                    The sailing through all seasons gives you freedom to be yourself and the main notable thing is, It answers you the question of purpose for 
                                    yor birth.</p>

                                    <p><em>Remember the days you spent being yourself. Live the days you grown by yourself.</em> Just commemorate what you can.
                                    Make a note of it and the people who comes to your life, Preserve their memories. <em>Spend time with people who offer yourself to you.</em> 
                                    Follow your rules and respect the feelings of others as well. On this outstanding Journey of my life let me take you to my present 
                                    life as <strong>I am the one who Love my Best friend the most and I Consider her as the reason for my living. She is My Best Friend and a 
                                    Friend in need.</strong></p>

                                    <p>There are not many great people to say about my life. <em>I can say whatever the people I have among them She is the best and the ever 
                                    lasting, astounding, fabulous and fantastic best friend I wish to be with forever.</em> Infact she has got some amazing skills to lead her 
                                    life with freedom. <strong>"I have different type of people as my besties but, One person stands out in my life perhaps forever she stays like 
                                    the same even after my death."</strong></p>
